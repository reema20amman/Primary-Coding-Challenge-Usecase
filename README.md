# Primary Coding Challenge Usecase

## Description

This repository contains a solution for a primary coding challenge use case. The challenge involves working with a SQLite database (`Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite.db`), json and csv file. Based on this file, data transformation logic is performed using Python.

## Files

- `Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite.db`: This is the SQLite database file provided for the challenge. The database can be found [here]([https://github.com/sakthi-reema/Primary-Coding-Challenge-Usecase/blob/main/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite.db)
- `sqlite.py`: Contains Python code that creates a new table in the SQLite database by applying transformation logic. The code can be found [here]([https://github.com/sakthi-reema/Primary-Coding-Challenge-Usecase/blob/main/sqlite.py)
- `array-of-nested-objects.py`: This Python script utilizes the path constructor to extract matching data from each object in an array. The code can be found [here]([https://github.com/sakthi-re](https://github.com/sakthi-reema/Primary-Coding-Challenge-Usecase/blob/main/array-of-nested-objects.py)
