# Primary Coding Challenge Usecase

## Description

This repository contains a solution for a primary coding challenge use case. The challenge involves working with a SQLite database (`Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite.db`), json and csv file. Based on this file, data transformation logic is performed using Python.

## Files

- `Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite.db`: This is the SQLite database file provided for the challenge.
- `sqlite.py`: Contains Python code that creates a new table in the SQLite database by applying transformation logic.
- `array-of-nested-objects.py`: This Python script utilizes the path constructor to extract matching data from each object in an array. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/sakthi-re
